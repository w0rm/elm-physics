{-| Represents a physical body containing
user defined data, like a WebGL mesh.

By default bodies don’t move. To change this,
use [withBehavior](#withBehavior).

All bodies start out centered on the origin,
use [moveTo](#moveTo) to set the position.

The supported bodies are:

  - [block](#block),
  - [plane](#plane),
  - [sphere](#sphere),
  - [cylinder](#cylinder),
  - [particle](#particle).

For complex bodies check [compound](#compound).
